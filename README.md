# Fictitious web shop

This was an assignment for the React portion of my coding bootcamp. It is a basic website for a fictitious web-shop called "Handy Kitchen Appliances".

**Stack used**: JavaScript - React - React Router - CSS

## The brief

These were the detailed instructions for the assignment:

- Use React to create a website for a fictitious brand.
- Create a header component that displays a logo and company name. It should be able to welcome a user to the site or ask them to sign in, depending on boolean input.
- Create a landing page component that tells the user about the company.
- Create a product component that displays information about the products that the company sells.
- Edit your existing App.js file so that it displays the header component, the landing page component and at least three product components. Use an array of values and props to do this. Pass props to the header component to specify whether the user is logged in or not.
- Make sure that your application is attractively styled. Use any custom CSS and/or CSS libraries of your choice in this regard.
- Create a navigation menu component for the website for the fictitious company you have been working on in the last tasks. This component should include menu items for the home page, user profile page, shopping page, and legal page.
- Modify the App.js file to do the following:
  - Display the header component on every page.
  - Display the menu component on every page. The menu component should only display relevant items. For example, if the user is on the “shop” page, the “shop” menu item should no longer be displayed.
  - Only display the landing component on the home page (i.e. root URL “/”)
  - Display at least 3 product components when the “shop” menu item is selected.
- Create an interest calculator for the shopping website above. Add it as its own component and page with its own menu item and URL path.
  - The page should ask the user for their shopping total, and number of months over which they’d like to pay back said amount. Use a non-compounding interest rate of 20% to calculate their monthly payments as well as the total they will have paid over all the months.

## My contribution

Most of the files and folders in this repository are React-generated files. The code I wrote can be found in:

- /src/components
- /src/pages
- The main file is /src/App.js.
- The styling is in /src/App.css as well as per component.

## How to install this project

1. Clone the repository on Github into a directory of your choice.
2. If you don't already have Npm installed, go ahead and do that first.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the repository, and open a new terminal window. Type `npm install` to get the node modules on your local computer.
4. Type `npm start` to get the app up and running - it should open in a new browser tab.
